The LADSDB meeting will be an inspiring conference for all those working in any of the pivotal themes in Developmental Biology, including cellular and molecular signalling underlying developmental changes, gene regulatory networks and their evolution, transcriptional regulation and organogenesis, cell differentiation and reprogramming, stem cell biology, neurobiology, and regeneration. This is an exciting opportunity for all developmental biologists in the Americas and around the world to meet and discuss advances, approaches, experiences and  emerging questions and methods in the field.

The LASDB meeting 2017 will bring together a leading group of international scientists and a vibrant student community representing the multiple fronts in the contemporary field of Developmental Biology. This is the first time the Society will meet in Colombia, one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, at the core of the Americas. Medellín, at the heart of Colombia, is located at 1475 m above sea level and has an average temperature of 24°C (75.2°F). The city is a recommended destination in Latin America for academic meetings as well as for business and pleasure. We anticipate an extremely interactive and lively event attended by about 400 scientists from all around the world. Junior faculty, postdocs as well as graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to participate and to submit their research advances for short talks and posters in any of the central themes of the meeting.
