Operational Model

We mainly work two operational models for residential and commercial claims’ handling

	Task Model
We make a first quality contact with your customer (usually within a few hours after assignment), schedule and then complete a professional  inspection, prepare the estimate using state of the art software, and finally return a detailed report with images and complete sketches of our findings with a recommendation to your staff examiners who will complete the claim from that point forward.
	
	Managed Claims Model
We handle the claim from the initial quality contact to determine cause of loss and to set the appropriate reserves, all the way to settlement and final voice to voice contact with the insured (including any required correspondence under state law), just to have the claim closed in your system by your staff
